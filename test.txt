The error message Error: Cannot find module 'vscode' suggests that the  Node.js runtime is
unable to find the 'vscode' module. When you are developing a VS Code extension, this
module is normally provided by the  VS Code runtime environment, and it doesn't need to be
installed separately as a Node.js package.

Here are some things to consider:

Run in VS Code Extension Host: If you're running your code outside of VS Code's Extension Host
environment, then the 'vscode'  module won't be available. Generally, you can't run a VS Code
extension directly using ts-node or Node.js.
  Debug Configuration: The best way to debug and run your extension is by
setting up a debug configuration in VS Code. This

 will run your extension in a new VS Code Extension Host window where the
'vscode' module and other VS Code specific APIs will be available.

 Package.json: Make sure that vscode is listed as an engines in your
package.json. For example:

json Copy code
"engines": {     "vscode": "^1.60.0" },
